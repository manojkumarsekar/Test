Feature: Factsheet (CSV files) Reconciliations for PRU_Global_Basics

  As an User, I expect Factsheet (CSV) files generated by 2 different sources (SRC1 & SRC2) should be same.
  Reconciliation should be successful and if any differences between two files will be captured.

  Scenario: Set up Test data paths and prerequisites

    Given I assign "tests/features/factsheet/publish-recon/test-data/PRU_Global_Basics/AZURE" to variable "SRC1_TESTDATA_PATH"
    And I assign "tests/features/factsheet/publish-recon/test-data/PRU_Global_Basics/EAGLE" to variable "SRC2_TESTDATA_PATH"
    And I assign "tests/features/factsheet/publish-recon/test-data/Exceptions" to variable "EXCEPTIONS_PATH"

  Scenario Outline: Reconciliations of Factsheet : Fund Code "<fund_code>" for "<file>"

    Given I capture current time stamp into variable "recon.timestamp"
    And I assign "${SRC1_TESTDATA_PATH}/<fund_code>/<file>" to variable "SRC1_FILE"
    And I assign "${SRC2_TESTDATA_PATH}/<fund_code>/<file>" to variable "SRC2_FILE"
    And I assign "${EXCEPTIONS_PATH}/exceptions_<fund_code>_<file>_${recon.timestamp}.csv" to variable "EXCP_FILE"

    Then I expect reconciliation between generated CSV file "${SRC1_FILE}" and reference CSV file "${SRC2_FILE}" should be successful and exceptions to be written to "${EXCP_FILE}" file

    Examples: Fund Code SG2136
      | fund_code | file               |
      | SG2136    | TOP10_HOLDINGS.csv |
      | SG2136    | COUNTRY.csv        |
      | SG2136    | SECTOR.csv         |
